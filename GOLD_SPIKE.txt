# Project 2 EECS 494 -- Swarm Queen

# Controls

Player 1 is controlled with the arrow keys (or ASDW)
Player 2 is controlled with the left joystick on an xbox controller

# Gold Spike Mechanic

The most difficult technical aspect of this spike is the swarm movement. All the child blobs should focus/orbit around the queen blob of their respective player. Furthermore, smaller blobs should move faster than larger ones.
